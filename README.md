# Horiseon Refactor Challenge

## Prodect Description

The first challange was to refactor a landing page for a marketing agency. Semantic HTMl tags are added for the header, nav, main, aside and footer to make the code easier to read and ensure the page is optimised for search engines. Alt attributes are added for photos and icons to follow accessibility standards accessing the site with a screen reader. The CSS Style sheet has been updated to align with the semantic tags, as well as simplified by removing duplicate information. A title has been added to better describe the content of the page.

### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
